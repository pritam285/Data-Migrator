 * <BR><BR>
 * <P>
 * ManagerBuilder helps in building highly efficient and configurable <B><I>"Configuration 
 * Manager(s)"</I></B> from the abstract definitions (interfaces) of the manager provided by the 
 * applications. ManagerBuilder accepts XML resource name(s)/stream(s) as input and expects
 * all the configuration details including abstract manager definition(s) itself to be in the
 * input XML data.
 * </P>
 * 
 * <P>
 * ManagerBuilder in turn uses "CCG XML Bean Parser" but does not support ID-based adders. 
 * Just like "XML Bean Parser", this class also provides a handler (com.ccg.manager.ManagerHandler)
 * which can be used to customize the XML loading and provide additional reserve node/attribute
 * definitions. Unlike "XML Bean Parser", the dynamic manager being consructed also 
 * support getters also, ofcourse with few restrictions.
 * </P>
 * 
 * <P>
 * The resultant "Configuration Manager" itself can be configured in the input XML data.
 * CCG proposes certain standards for the "Configuration Managers", whcih in turn needs to
 * be followed by the application specific manager abstract definitions.Following is the 
 * list of standards to be maintained by CCG compatible managers:
 * </P>
 * 		<OL>
 * 			<LI><B>Abstractness:</B> Manager itself should not be a class, it should be a 
 * 				public interface(s) and no implementations of this interface(s)
 * 				needs to be provided. In fact, a dynamic object will be built by CCG 
 * 				using these interface(s).
 *			</LI>
 * 			<LI><B>Setters and Getters:</B> The interface can have standard setter and getter 
 * 				properties of any type.
 *			</LI>
 * 			<LI><B>Adders and Getters:</B> The adders and getters proposed by CCG are little 
 * 				different from standard ones. Here adder will have only one parameter whose 
 * 				type should be same as corresponding getter return type. And getter should 
 * 				take a String parameter which is actually an ID for the bean to be 
 * 				fetched, which inturn is specified in XML. Note, adder doesn�t take any ID 
 * 				parameter, the ID�s are maintained internally by dynamic objects built by CCG.
 *			</LI>
 *		</OL>
 * <BR>
 * 
 * <P>
 * Even though the dynamic manager constructed supports only above mentioned standard methods,
 * the behaviour of the other methods present in manager definition(s) can be customized using
 * below mentioned reserve nodes.
 * </P>
 * 
 * 
 * <BR>
 * <B><U>Reserve Node(s) and Attribute(s)</U></B>
 * <P>
 * Some of the reserve nodes supported by ManagerBuilder are XML specific, some are 
 * root node specific and some are for method behaviour customizations. So the reserve nodes
 * and attributes supported by this class can be grouped and described as follows:
 * 
 * 
 * <BR><BR>
 * <B> First XML resource specific reserve attributes:</B>
 * <P>
 * As mentioned earlier ManagerBuilder supports loading/building of "Configuration Manager"
 * from multiple XML files. Among these, the first XML resource/stream hold a critical
 * information such as the manager abstract definitions and specifications for undleying
 * caching mechanism. <I><B>All the below mentioned reserve attributes should be present
 * only in the root node of the first XML resource. Otherwise they will be simply

 * 		<OL>
 * 			<LI>
 * 				<B><U>Method Mapping</U></B>:  In this methods are mapped using a nested property string. This 
 * 				customization can be done in XML using reserve node "methodMap". This reserve node takes
 * 				following three attributes:
 * 				<BR><BR>
 * 					<TABLE Border="1">
 * 						<TR>
 * 							<TH>Attribute Name</TH>
 * 							<TH>Description</TH>
 * 						</TR>
 * 						<TR>
 * 							<TD>method</TD>
 * 							<TD>
 * 								Specifies the method name to be configured. (<B>root method</B>)
 * 							</TD>
 * 						</TR>
 * 						<TR>
 * 							<TD>property</TD>
 * 							<TD>
 * 								Specifies the nested property separated by a dot. Note, here the property means getter 
 * 								names without prefix "get"/"is".<BR>
 * 								Eg: company.employee.name which represents call getCompany().getEmployee().getName()
 * 							</TD>
 * 						</TR>
 * 						<TR>
 * 							<TD>paramString</TD>
 * 							<TD>
 * 								Specifies the mapping of the main method (specified in "method" attribute) parameters
 * 								to the parameters to be passed to the properties at different levels.
 * 								<BR><BR>
 * 								The parameters (main method parameter numbers) to be passed to a method at a 
 * 								particular level is separated by comma and these parameter strings at different
 * 								levels are separated by pipe. 
 * 							</TD>
 * 						</TR>
 * 					</TABLE>
 * 				<BR>
 * 				<P>
 *				For example consider following XML data,<BR>
 *					<span align="center">
 *							&lt;ccg:methodMap method="getErrorGroup" property="bundle.resourceBundle.errorGroup" paramString="0|1|0"/&gt;
 *					</span>
 *				<BR>The above mapping means that whenever  getErrorGroup("val1","val2") is called invoke<BR> 
 *					<span align="center">
 *						getBundle("val1").getResourceBundle("val2").getErrorGroup("val1")
 *					</span>
 *				<BR>and return the resultant value.
 *				</P>
 *
 *				<P>
 *				<B>Method Matching</B>: A negative parameter index indicates presence of parameter and it can be
 *				any type. And during execution null will be passed for this parameter. If overloaded versions are
 *				available, the given specification should match one and only one method, otherwise appropriate
 *				exceptions will be thrown.
 *				<BR>
 *  			During the input XML data loading, the method map will be used to make a "compile-time validation".
 *  			That is, the given specification should match with the signature of the methods (not on run time
 *  			return values). And using this specification, a "Method Sequence" (com.ccg.util.MethodSequence)
 *  			will be built which will be used during the method calls, which in turns tunes the performance (as
 *  			the parsing, validation and method selections are performed only once and that to at the time of 
 *  			XML loading).
 *				<BR>
 *				Note: If no paramstring is specified, then parameters of "root method" will be ditributed among the methods
 *				specified in "property". First parameter at first level, second parameter at second level and
 *				so on.  
 *				</P>
 * 			</LI>
 * 			<LI>
 * 				<B><U>Proxy Method Declaration</U></B>: A method can be configured to be proxy using reserve node
 * 				"proxyMethod" which takes method name parameter in attribute "method". Note, in order to declare a
 * 				method as proxy method, "Method Proxy" should be declared in root node using reserve attribute
 * 				"methodProxy". When the configured method is called on the "Dynamic Manager", the "Method Proxy" 
 * 				execute() method will be called and the parameters of the configured method will be passed as
 * 				object array.
 * 				<BR>
 * 				Note: If specified method is not found then appropriate exception will be thrown but unlike 
 * 				"Method Matching" if overloaded versions are found no exception will be thrown. Instead all 
 * 				overloaded versions with this name will be configured as proxy methods.
 * 			</LI>
 * 		</OL>
